# Getting Started with CUDA Programming

CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) that allows developers to harness the power of NVIDIA GPUs for general-purpose computing.

## What is CUDA?

CUDA enables dramatic increases in computing performance by harnessing the power of the graphics processing unit (GPU). With millions of cores available in modern GPUs, CUDA allows you to accelerate compute-intensive applications.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into CUDA programming, you'll need:

- An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA Compute Capability 3.0 or higher
- CUDA Toolkit installed on your system
- A compatible C/C++ compiler
- Basic knowledge of C/C++ programming

## Your First CUDA Program

Let's start with a simple "Hello World" program:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

__global__ void helloKernel() {
    printf("Hello from GPU thread %d!\n", threadIdx.x);
}

int main() {
    // Launch kernel with 10 threads
    helloKernel<<<1, 10>>>();
    
    // Wait for GPU to finish
    cudaDeviceSynchronize();
    
    printf("Hello from CPU!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

## Key Concepts

### Kernels
A kernel is a function that runs on the GPU. It's marked with the `__global__` keyword.

### Thread Hierarchy
CUDA organizes threads into:
- **Threads**: Individual execution units
- **Blocks**: Groups of threads
- **Grids**: Collections of blocks

### Memory Hierarchy
CUDA has several memory types:
- **Global Memory**: Accessible by all threads
- **Shared Memory**: Shared within a block
- **Local Memory**: Private to each thread

## Compilation

To compile your CUDA program:

```bash
nvcc -o hello hello.cu
```

## Next Steps

In the next post, we'll explore CUDA memory management and learn how to efficiently transfer data between CPU and GPU.
